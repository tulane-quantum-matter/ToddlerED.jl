# ToddlerED

[![Build Status](https://github.com/tulane-quantum-matter/ToddlerED.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/tulane-quantum-matter/ToddlerED.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

Simple code for exact-diagonalization calculations with some number of (majorana) fermion and spin-1/2 operators.

Operators built up from tensor products of Pauli / Clifford algebra matrices.

Immediate predecessor is baby-ED by J,S-K.
